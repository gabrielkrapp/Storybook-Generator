## Technologies Used

Replace your-backend-url with the URL of your backend and your-openai-api-key with your OpenAI API key.

## Known Bug
There's a known issue where occasionally the OpenAI API may return incomplete stories. This is being investigated, and a fix will be implemented as soon as possible.
